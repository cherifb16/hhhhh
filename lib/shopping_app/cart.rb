  # Requirements
  # - The purchase amount of all items in the cart（Cart#items）is transferred from the cart owner's wallet to the item owner's wallet.
  # - The owner rights of all items in the cart（Cart#items）are transferred to the cart owner.
  # - The contents of the cart（Cart#items）are emptied.

  # Hints
  # - Wallet of the owner of the cart ==> self.owner.wallet
  # - Item owner's wallet ==> item.owner.wallet
  # - Money being transferred ==> withdrawing the amount from someone's wallet and depositing the amount into someone else's wallet
  # - The owner of the item is transferred to the owner of the cart ==> The owner is rewritten (item.owner = ?)
